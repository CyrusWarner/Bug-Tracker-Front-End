This app was created using React for the front-end and ASP.NET Core for the back-end of this application.

This application consists of multiple APIs to make me even more comfortable with using APIS while programming. I made this application for Software Developers looking for a way to track the bugs in their applications. The app comes with a system for emailing other users, chatting with other users, taking notes, and keeping track of your bugs to work on with a clickable calendar that displays the bugs to work on for the day with the assignees.

Board Home consists of showing the bugs and if you are an admin of the board you can create a new bug or mark a bug as complete or in progress
